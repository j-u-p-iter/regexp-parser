1. Formulate all theoretical aspects about the parser - starting from the Formal Grammar till Tokenizer and Parser itself.
2. Read books: a) Parsing Techniques. A Practical Guide. Second Edition; b) Compilers: principles, techniques, and tools, 2nd edition.
3. Create RegExp parser project, similar to this one https://regexr.com/ (the project is cloned to the GitHub and can be used for learning purposes).
4. Use redux toolkit to create RegExp parser project and describe in form of documentation your experience of usage of this awesome library.
5. Implement error handling system, based on this plan https://github.com/j-u-p-iter/blog/issues/333 while creating RegExp parser project.
