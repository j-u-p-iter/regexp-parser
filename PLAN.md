1. Formulate all theoretical aspects about the parser - starting from the Formal Grammar till Tokenizer and Parser itself.
2. Read books: a) Parsing Techniques. A Practical Guide. Second Edition; b) Compilers: principles, techniques, and tools, 2nd edition.
3. Create RegExp parser project, similar to this one https://regexr.com/ (the project is cloned to the GitHub and can be used for learning purposes).
4. Use redux toolkit to create RegExp parser project and describe in form of documentation your experience of usage of this awesome library.
5. Implement error handling system, based on this plan https://github.com/j-u-p-iter/blog/issues/333 while creating RegExp parser project.



1. Frontend Masters courses.
2. Build bundler from scratch.
3. Build parser from scratch.


Allways start with simple and don't add a lot of details at the same time during development and studying.

You should have:

1. 1 book to read - NodeJS Advanced Patterns Third edition. (https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/node-js-design-patterns/9781839214110/Text/Chapter_1.xhtml#_idParaDest-29)
2. 1 Project to work on - Parser.
3. 1 new topic to study - Algorithms (Udemy). For each topic create small NextJS project to formulate the main rules.
4. 1 Course to watch - Parser (Udemy).


These are the things you should be working on constantly. Don't add additional complexity in terms of new topics until you finish with the current ones.
Create todo list all projects you want to implement in the future, but don't start them until you completely finish with the current ones.

Todo List:

- testing framework;
- builder;
- CLI parser;
- look at Vercel projects and try to simulate them.
