# Regex Grammar

There're two possible ways to write the grammar:
  - bottom-up;
  - top-bottom.


In the top-bottom case we start with the most general rules (non-terminals and production rules) and go down, adding production rules for the non-terminals from the above rules.

In the bottom-up case we start with the simplest cases - simple terminals and non-terminals. After that we go to the top, combining previously declared terminals and non-terminals and adding new ones, formulating more general and complex production rules.
