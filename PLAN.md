1. Formulate all theoretical aspects about the parser - starting from the Formal Grammar till Tokenizer and Parser itself.
2. Read books: a) Parsing Techniques. A Practical Guide. Second Edition; b) Compilers: principles, techniques, and tools, 2nd edition.
3. Create RegExp parser project, similar to this one https://regexr.com/ (the project is cloned to the GitHub and can be used for learning purposes).
4. Use redux toolkit to create RegExp parser project and describe in form of documentation your experience of usage of this awesome library.
5. Implement error handling system, based on this plan https://github.com/j-u-p-iter/blog/issues/333 while creating RegExp parser project.



1. Frontend Masters courses.
2. Build bundler from scratch.
3. Build parser from scratch.
4. Learn linux. This is the basis of everything else.
5. Stick to this plan: https://github.com/j-u-p-iter/coding-interview-university.
6. Build Flash Cards application for both - desktop and mobile devices.
7. https://github.com/DmitrySoshnikov/javascript-algorithms


Allways start with simple and don't add a lot of details at the same time during development and studying.

You should have:

1. 1 book to read - NodeJS Advanced Patterns Third edition. (https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/node-js-design-patterns/9781839214110/Text/Chapter_1.xhtml#_idParaDest-29)
2. 1 Project to work on - Parser.
3. 1 new topic to study - Algorithms (Udemy). For each topic create small NextJS project to formulate the main rules.
4. 1 Course to watch - Parser (Udemy).


These are the things you should be working on constantly. Don't add additional complexity in terms of new topics until you finish with the current ones.
Create todo list all projects you want to implement in the future, but don't start them until you completely finish with the current ones.

Todo List:

- testing framework;
- builder;
- CLI parser;
- look at Vercel projects and try to simulate them;
- look at AdonisJS Framework projects and try to reimplement them.
- try to reimplement this super thing: https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa#readme
- great amount of tools to investigate and reimplement: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs


The very, very important note: I'm learning not to be the best of the best. This is not possible. I'm learning cause I feel it's mine. Cause I literally like it. And it makes me better first and foremost like a person. There are a lot of people concentrating on coding like a mantra. I have a lot of interests in my life: Fitness, Coding, Public speaking, Learning Foreing Language, Meeting new people (intentionally), Conspiracy Theories, Data Science, Algorythms, Trading and I want to practise in all these areas. Of course it's much easier to concentrate only on one areat and master it. But it's not my way. I believe the way I'm doint it is very proffitable for my personality. So, taking these all into account - don't punish yourself that you don't know something, or you are not good enough, or you don't know something other know. This is not rational way to do things. Create plan, stick to this plan and continue moving forward. Always remind yourself that you do everything you can. The goal is not to become the best. The goal is to improve daily. Only doing this you'll be in 1% of the best. But again, this is not a goal. The goal is to move forward and enjoy the process. Only doing this you'll be very valuable. Do what you do and be what will be.

The huge advantage I have is the knoledge that I don't need serious relationships, wife, children. It opens huge window of perspectives for me since it gives me a lot of time to get additional education.

Moreover it's not only the subject knowledge which is valuable. It's also about your experience, your ability to discuss problems, ability to ask correct questions, ability to work in a team, to structure the process, to give good suggestions, ability to communicate with the team. And all it comes with experience, that comes with time. And IMO I have huge and very valuable experience.
